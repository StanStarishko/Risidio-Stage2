# AI-powered UX Audit Tool â€” Summary

human
## Why
To provide small teams with a fast, directional UX and accessibility review without a full research cycle.

## What
A web app where the user submits a URL. The backend fetches the HTML, performs quick heuristics (headings, alt attributes, contrast sampling, metadata), then asks an LLM for actionable recommendations grouped by theme.

## Who
- Primary: founders, solo developers, and small product teams.
- Secondary: agencies gathering discovery insights for pre-sales.

## How
- Frontend: Next.js + Tailwind CSS; skimmable dashboard + permalink report.
- Backend: Node.js (Express) with HTML fetch & heuristics; OpenAI for structured advice.
- Hosting: Vercel or split FE/BE as needed.
- Deliverables Today: working MVP (URL â†’ report), GitHub repo link, live demo, screenshots.

## Scope (One-day)
- MVP flow: Submit URL â†’ Heuristics â†’ LLM summary â†’ Report UI.
- Must-haves: alt coverage, H1/H2/H3 map, link count, meta presence, quick wins list.
- Nice-to-haves: PDF export, shareable link, attach Lighthouse JSON.

## Risks & Mitigations
- CORS/blocked fetch: server-side fetch; fallback to pasted HTML.
- Heuristic accuracy: present raw stats alongside advice; clarify directional nature.
- Rate limits: cache results per URL for 15 minutes.
